A great place to get a burger! This project allows you to pick and choose from many 
types of burgers. It also allows you to add toppings and select the size of your combos.
You can log in so your information can be saved for future use, and you can even use 
your Gmail to make things go much smoother. You can customize your profile, and if you're
an admin, you can add more items to the menu. Also, once you add items to the cart, you 
can pay for them and see your order for later reference.
